policy: "<h2>Dear Valued Clients,</h2>  
<p>Thank you for choosing The North Glengarry and putting your trust in us! We recognize that COVID-19 has encouraged all of us to be more mindful as we carry on throughout our day and we have implemented necessary changes to our daily routines. Our “Living with COVID-19” action plan was developed with the guidance of governing health & safety authorities to keep you safe. Rest assured, we will be monitoring these new procedures daily and adjust them as needed to ensure the safety of all who eats at our restaurant!</p><br />
<h2>Additional Safety Measures:</h2><br />
<h3> Increased Sanitization Process:</h3><br />
<p>We are reinforcing recommendations provided by the appropriate health and safety requirements throughout our operations. Strict and thorough cleaning and sanitization of all touch-points including all surfaces in common areas, public washrooms, team work stations, payment machines, menus and all other client-facing components. Hand sanitizing stations are set up in common areas. We have removed items not easily disinfected.</p><br />
<h2>On-Site Safety Requirements</h2><br />
<p>As Ontario law requires our seating capacity is limited to 50, with a maximum of 4 patrons per table. All tables are at least 2 meters apart. Face coverings for all clients are mandatory except when eating or drinking. We ask you to respectfully consider those restrictions when you come and visit our establishments.</p>"
