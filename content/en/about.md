heading2: "Our History"

ourhistory: "<p>Built in 1819, the restaurant structure is the oldest standing building in Alexandria. Nicknamed the “Priest’s Mill,” it originally served as a grist mill, built by Scottish immigrant Father Alexander Macdonnell, who also founded St. Raphael’s parish and inspired the name for the town of Alexandria.</p>
<br>
<p>The building remained resilient to multiple fires as it served as a grist, stone, and roller mill over the next 150 years. In the 1970s, the building was renovated into a restaurant, eventually taking on the name you see today: “The North Glengarry.”</p>
<br>
<p>The image of the historic mill remains preserved in our picturesque patio, the only one of its kind in the area! Come experience a delicious meal with a view of the old dam and stone waterway. Be serenaded by the peaceful sound of the waterfall, fed by the nearby Garry River and Mill Pond.</p>"
